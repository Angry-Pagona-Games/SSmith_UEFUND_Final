## Tasks, instructions and learning objectives:

## "Unreal Paradise" project description:
### Objective:
- Write a brief description of your "Unreal Paradise".
- The concept summary of your vision for your world/environment/level.
- This can be something you have been thinking about for a while, an idea for a game or used in conjunction with a game design document from other courses or projects. 

## Gather reference materials and create a mood board
### Objective: 
- Source and curate inspiration and reference materials for your “Unreal Paradise” to guide the creative direction of the project. 
- Utilize PureRef or any other mood board software to create your mood board.   

## Create a blank project
### Objective: 
- Set up a new Unreal Engine project, choosing to utilize starter content and add in either the first or third person template.  
- This can be done at project creation or prior to playtesting.

## Create a landscape
### Objective: 
- Use landscape mode to sculpt the initial terrain, forming the basis of the paradise setting. 
- Utilize any of the learnt techniques and consider the play space with near and far away features. 

## Create and/or apply a basic landscape material
### Objective:
- Develop and/or apply a basic multi-layer landscape material to the terrain.
- You may use any landscape material you'd like.
- You can utilize the material we created with the course or one you download from the marketplace. 

## Basic asset placement and kitbashing with assets
### Objective:
- Import assets via Quixel Bridge or any other importing techniques and engage in kitbashing to create structures or focal points that support your description. 
- We have not yet learnt about gameplay mechanics but still having ideas of how another artist (or your future self perhaps) is a great thing to be thinking of as you kitbash.
- Just dropping in assets is easy, think about WHY are you adding them? 
- What will there purpose be? Does it support your vision?   

## Refine your world and terrain
### Objective:
- Iterate over the terrain with more sculpting or painting as needed to support the kitbashing/asset placement.
- Basic integration of assets into your world.
- Apply foliage or scatter down assets to populate your world with vegetation/props. 

## Create/adjust materials for props and assets
### Objective:
- Adjust materials on props or kitbashed assets by utilizing material instances.

## Final review, iteration, playtest! 
### Objective:
- Self assess, iterate and make final adjustments before submitting your work for feedback.
- Ensure the scene is in a polished state for review.
- Do not aim for perfection! Iteration, trial and error, test out ideas or looks and do not be afraid to make changes.
- Experiment and have fun as you create and indulge your Unreal imaginations!
- Playtesting is listed last but should be done throughout the process.
